# Exploring Quarto!

Trying out the new, hot tool during NCEAS data-science-chats ☺️ Check out the [exploring_quarto.qmd](https://github.com/data-science-chats/fun-with-quarto/blob/main/exploring_quarto.qmd) to see examples of:

* editing global options in the yaml header
* using hash pipes `#|` to add code chunk options
* figure captions (for multiple figures in the same chunk)
* referencing figures in text using their labels
* adding callouts
* using the visual editor to easily add a table
* rendering an output in the document margin
